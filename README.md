This repository is exists solely for educational purposes.  It's all the code I used while writing an article about ES6 Modules, Browserify, and Babelify.  You can read that article [here](http://advantcomp.com/blog/ES6Modules/).  

If you have any questions, tweet me at @AdamCoard.  If there are mistakes here, submit a pull request or just let me know and I'll happily fix 'em.
